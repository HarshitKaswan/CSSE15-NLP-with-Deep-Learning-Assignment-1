## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project implements a **count-based vector representation** of words using a **co-occurrence matrix**.  
The embeddings are reduced to 2D using **PCA** and plotted for visualization.  

### Features:
- Corpus tokenization (news dataset included in code)
- Distinct word extraction
- Co-occurrence matrix construction with configurable window size
- Dimensionality reduction (PCA)
- 2D visualization of word embeddings (saved as `embeddings.png`)
- Report written in LaTeX (Overleaf-ready)
